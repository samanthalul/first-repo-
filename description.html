        <p class="queen2"> Who was Tiana Tran? Over these past dozen or so months, she has gone by many names, Mommy, Queen, Baby, My Love, and now, unfortuantely, My Ex. Despite all this, I have no hard feelings for her whatsoever, in fact, I only have good things to say about her. From the first day I met her, I was introduced to a hardworking, ambitious, compationate, and genrous woman. From that day on, even before we dated she has done nothing but motivate and push me to work towards and achieve greater things. However, If i ever were to fail, my Queen would be nothing but supportive and caring and would always help me back on my feet. She always looked after me, and make sure I was feeling well at all times. In her presences, I was not allowed to feel hungry, sad, mad, or upset because she would always make sure I was feeling otherwise. From the first time i held her hand, to the last time I've layed a finger on her soft, silky skin, I remember every last moment I've spent with her. unfortuantely, although she was dam near perfect, I was not. I messed up and hopefully I'll be able to right my wrongs and win her back.</p>
